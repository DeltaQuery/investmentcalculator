# About the Project

In the world of financial education, emphasis is usually placed on estimates of future returns, in a given period, with a given discount rate. This with the aim of demonstrating the power of compound interest and the benefits of investment.

Investment Calculator is a calculator that allows you to prove, through history, that these future returns are possible. Instead of calculating into the future, an asset (ETF or stock) is chosen, a starting date in the past, a period of time, an initial contribution and periodic contributions (monthly or annual), thus calculating certain metrics at the end of the period , such as ROI or CAGR.

For example: How much money would you have today, if you had invested in Google, the initial amount of $5,000, on January 1, 2020, plus annual contributions of $200, for a period of 20 years? What would be the total interest earned, CAGR and ROI? Those are the answers that the calculator can provide.
